# Fictionary
A dictionary that sometimes tells the truth.

Fictionary is an offline-first Progressive Web App that leverages ASP.NET Core, Blazor and Webassembly to bring you word definitions that are only sometimes true.

Fictionary is brought to you in stunning Material Design with an included dark theme.

> **Warning**
> 
> Just to be clear, you have no control over Fictionary's results. It may choose to display a made-up definition for any number of reasons, which may include but are not limited to:
> - Completely at random.
> - As a response to internal errors.
> - As a response to nonsense input ([Nonsense in, nonsense out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)).
> - Just because it doesn't like you.
