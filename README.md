# Fictionary
A dictionary that sometimes tells the truth.

Fictionary is an offline-first Progressive Web App that leverages ASP.NET Core, Blazor and Webassembly to bring you word definitions that are only sometimes true.

> â€” <cite>Dude trust me<cite>

Fictionary is brought to you in stunning Material Design with an included dark theme.

> **Warning**
> 
> Just to be clear, you have no control over Fictionary's results. It may choose to display a made-up definition for any number of reasons, which may include but are not limited to:
> - Completely at random.
> - As a response to internal errors.
> - As a response to nonsense input ([Nonsense in, nonsense out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out)).
> - Just because it doesn't like you.
